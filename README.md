## Design and Tools
#### Public API
[Sails.js](http://sailsjs.com/) is a MVC web framework that makes it easy to whip up a quick data-driven REST API. I choose to construct my API with this framework because it has a quick start up time. The framework can also be grown to support many other features such as: websocket integration, any datebase integration, and many more. Although I didn't utilize all those features, I implemented what was required to complete the project at a reasonable time.

#### Public App
[Aurelia](http://aurelia.io/) is an extensible client framework that I used to create the full experience for the application. I utilized Aurelia's two-way databinding and routing to create the single page application. I also used [jQuery](https://jquery.com/), [Bootstrap](getbootstrap.com/), [Select2](https://select2.github.io/), [Alertify](alertifyjs.com/), and [Google Maps Place Autocomplete](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/places-autocomplete) to provide better user experience without having to write my own libraries.

## Workflow and Prioritizing
There were many things I would love to implement if I had more time, you can have my backlog and completed tasks that I did to delivery this project. This project is still in progress, all progress should not affect your experience but only enhance it.
